## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git?
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
3. Why do we create a branch? 
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?
7. What is a merge conflict?
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?


1. Git is an Open Source Distributed Version Control System. It is essentially our 
program of command. 

2. The difference between Git and Github is the fact that Git is what we use to start 
our program of code and Github is the source to where we publish and send our code 
for review or interaction. 

3. We create a branch because we do not want to make edits on the main branch, we 
want to make our own edits on our own branch so that we can see what changes were 
made and we can easily go back to the main branch if our created branch has an error. 

4. The purpose of a pull request is to update the local repo from our local computer 
to all of the branches that are attatched to our repo. 

5. Git Switch is the command we can use to switch between branches. 

6. Git Pull is a git command used to update the current local working branch, Git Merge is to 
help integrate the lines of development created by the git branch into a single branch, Git 
Fetch is the command we use when we want to see what changes have been made to a repo. 

7. A merge conflict occurs when the same line of code is changed in different ways in two 
branches, meaning that git cannot process how to merge the changes made to the branches. 

8. Resolving a merge conflict involves the developers needing to be on the same page of what 
code should be placed in the right spots of the repo. Only way to actually merge succesfully is 
if the updates are similar.
